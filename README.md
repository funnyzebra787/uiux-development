The goal of this project is to help a user who is looking to buy Tesla cars.
There are many different types of Tesla cars, however, and this project will help the 
user narrow down their search to a specific type of Tesla car. It helps the user sort
the cars based on price and length, and the user can also filter cars based on SUV or Sedan, or 
gas or electric. User can also add many cars to their cart and see the total price of all their cars.
Or even remove cars from their cart.

The app is organized into a list of ListItem components, and each component takes in props such as fuel type, price,
length, etc., to display the cars in the catalog. Then, their is a cart state that updates based on what is in the cart.

This app has great usability and layout, with three distinct columns that are easy to see. Also, the car panels themselves
have the attributes spread out to the left and to the right, and it is not all scrunched together. This way, the user can
easily see the differences in attributes such as length, price, and fuel type.
